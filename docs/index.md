<h4>Intro / Professional Self-Assessment</h4>

<p>
    I have greatly enjoyed my career as a student in the SNHU Computer Science program. There was a lot to learn about theory, technology, and the application of programming principles in software development. Although my time in the program is coming to an end, and I will be happily graduating with my degree in Computer Science, I am aware that the professional field of technology is an ever-evolving space, and I will have to be proactive about learning new developments in the industry to keep my skills and coding practices sharp. 
</p>

<p>
  	There was a lot that I have learned about the underlying Computer Science fundamentals in this program. Specifically, the role that Data Structures and Algorithms play in software development. I believe that a lot of the fundamentals are being abstracted away with new technologies that make a developerâ€™s life easy, however it is important to be aware of the fact that all of these new technologies are relying on the same fundamentals that got us to where we are here today with respect to all things Computer Science. So, having had the experience of learning about the fundamentals, I have attained a great appreciation of their importance and the role they play in the grand scheme of things. 
</p>

<p>
  	With regards to the capstone course, I am appreciative of the fact that I was able to bring all my knowledge together and demonstrate it in the form of updating an existing application that I have worked on in the past. It was a great recap of the many things I have learned thus far, and their application to an actual scenario, which I will be further updating in the future. 
</p>

<p>
  	I cannot wait to showcase my skills to my future employers and start my journey towards a career as a technology professional.
